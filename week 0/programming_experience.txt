The programming languages that I am proficient in are Python, Latex, Markdown, and Mathematica. I have had exposure in Bash and C, but would not consider myself proficient in them. I have roughly three 

years of Python experience, one year in Latex/Markdown, and roughly six months in Bash. The IDE I commonly use is VScode. The programming language classes that I have taken have been a mix of Physics 

and Computer Science courses. The computational physics courses I have taken have been the use of Python libraries in mass data analysis such as Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Astropy, etc. This course will 

be my first computer science class at Oregon State. My other CS courses I have taken have been at Linn-Benton Community College.
